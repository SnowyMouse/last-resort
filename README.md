# Last Resort
Tool for convincing Gearbox tags to work with the Xbox version of Halo.

This tool is used for converting HUD meters and multipurposes to the channel orders the Xbox uses. It can also convert sound tags to Xbox ADPCM.

**NOTE: This tool is HIGHLY destructive. Changes cannot be undone once run. It is HIGHLY recommended to use -o to write changes to a separate tags directory.**
